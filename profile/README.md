**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - A repository to showcase our (Gensis Montejo and Abhishek Mishra) work with Professor Tien Nguyen?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - Browse through our documents to find what we have worked on and what we are working on...?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
